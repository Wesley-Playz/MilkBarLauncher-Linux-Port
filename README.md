# MilkBarLauncher-Linux-Port

I don't think this project will ever be possible (if it is, feel free to contribute).

A CLI Linux port of MilkBarLauncher.

To build: just run this command in CMD (inside of the folder with the sln file): `dotnet publish -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -c Release`.
